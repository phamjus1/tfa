# Tracking For Animation

A hacky network based solution for sending face tracking data over TCP sockets for use in Generalized developement platforms.

Currently using a combination of dlib and OpenCV for face tracking (tracking facial landmarks, pupil position and head pose rotation) in Python 3.

# TODO
1. Swap server client
2. Add placeholder face rig
